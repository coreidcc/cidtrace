first draft of instrumentation using javassist

- generates basic enter/leave traces by emitting JUL.log calls
- per default instrument all public methods of all classes
- demonstrate the use of annotations to fine tune tracing

Missing.... hell a lot
- global configuration to control
  - which classes/packages to be instrumented
  - list for to be masked out method parameters
- refine annotation support
- application of sane configuration defaults
- dedicated getter/setter support
- decent coverage with automated tests

FIXMEs/HACKs:
- some hard coded class/package names
- get rid of quick and dirty shell scripts
- ger rid of Main and Point classes

Optimization:
- minimize string concatenations
